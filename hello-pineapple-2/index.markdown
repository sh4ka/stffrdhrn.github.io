<p>For a few days during the 2006 chinese new year I took a trip down south to å±±ä¸œ to meet my friend åˆ˜å²©.  While visiting we didn't have much to do but we were able to find some fun lighting off fire crackers.</p>
<p>The first night we found an old broken sink.  There was a small crack in the sink just big enough to fit a stick of home-made explosives.  Once we had placed the sink in a safe location we inserted the explosives and lit the fuse.  After running back a few hundred feet the sink exploded, seconds later we could hear the shrapnel of the sink landing all around us.</p>
<p>The next day we started to look for something else to explode.  First we thought of a watermelon.  The problem was the watermelons are expensive.  Instead we found a nice cheap grapefruit as shown below.</p>

<p>The pineapple sitting on part of the sink which we blew up the night before.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" title="Bombs" href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7483.JPG"><img width="128" height="96" id="image24" alt="Bombs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7483.thumbnail.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>The homemade explosives.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" title="The Hole" href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7481.JPG"><img width="128" height="96" id="image25" alt="The Hole" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7481.thumbnail.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>A hole was carved in the bottom of the pineapple to fit the explosives.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" title="Insertion" href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7485.JPG"><img width="128" height="96" id="image26" alt="Insertion" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7485.thumbnail.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Perfect fit. The pineable bomb is primed and ready.  We lit the fuse and ran again.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" title="Still there" href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7486.JPG"><img width="128" height="96" id="image27" alt="Still there" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7486.thumbnail.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Peices of the pineapple ended up everywhere.  The head was mostly still in tack. Not quite the effect we were looking for.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" title="Nothing Left" href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7487.JPG"><img width="128" height="96" id="image28" alt="Nothing Left" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7487.thumbnail.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>The dirt mound is now covered in pineapple shreddings.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" title="Close up" href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7488.JPG"><img width="128" height="96" id="image29" alt="Close up" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/IMG_7488.thumbnail.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Closer look.</p>
