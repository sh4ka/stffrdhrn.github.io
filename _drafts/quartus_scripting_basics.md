`Outline only`

Altera's scripting environment is Quartus is very powerful but it might look like
a high bar to hurdle.. 

## The basics

In the `quartus/bin` directory there are several scripts called `quartus_*`.  These these are wrappers which are all the  exact same script which just setup the environment then call binaries of the same name in the `quartus/{arch}/bin` directory. 

Each script has different features ...

### Initialization

### Cool things you can do

You can use the scripts to do your fpga design end to end without a gui.
