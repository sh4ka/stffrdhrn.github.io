<h2>Interests</h2>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>I have knowledge in both Network and Application level security.  I have knowledge and experience in securely configuring and designing networks, network servers, services and firewalls.  I have implemented  scalable solutions which defend against network attacks at connection level as well as deal with deep content scanning.</p>
<p>At the application level I am familiar with methods for identifying and patching security issues. I am familiar with low level software security issues like <em>Format String</em> and <em>Buffer Overflow</em> vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Cryptography and the math behind it is also interesting to me. I have implemented STARTTLS on mail servers and have a deep understanding of Private/Public key encryption schemes.</p>
<h3>Web Applications</h3>
<p>I am interested in working with web applications and services. Specifically I find java and its surrounding  technologies a great platform to develop web applications on. Lately, I have found Spring to be integral framework  for designing web applications which also has merits in java applications which do not reside on the web.</p>
<p>I have experience developing network services which include SNMP, JMX as well as using  SYSLOG through log4j as a management framework for web applications.</p>
<p>As a continuation of this I have experience with building and maintaining custom tuned Linux distributions for use as web application deployment platforms.  My distribution development experience includes Linux kernel   and file system tuning to target web application, database and network performance.</p>
<h3>Networking &amp; Administration</h3>
<p>I administer several machine as simply a part of software development and ensure they all run smoothly  and can synchronise and backup their settings and other information over a LAN. I write many shell scripts &amp; C programs  to help with this - as well as know how to configure all the services on my systems (dhcp, dns, apache, mail, users  etc.)</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>I have hobbies of guitar, snowboarding, hiking and cycling. I can speak Chinese fluently and German reasonably OK. I enjoy speaking and learning foreign languages, as well as travel.</p>
