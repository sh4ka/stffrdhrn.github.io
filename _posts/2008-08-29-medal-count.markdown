<p>As everyone knows, the Beijing olympics is over and the medal counts are in.  Who is on top? If you look at news agecies from <a href="http://2008.cctv.com/08/index.shtml">China</a>, <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/beijing_olympics/">Australia</a> or <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics/medals_table/default.stm">Great Britain</a> they will tell you the Chinese, who have the most gold medals.  But if you look at the <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/">US</a> Olympic coverage they will tell you USA is in first with the most <em>Total</em> medals. Now why can't the United States of America just do things like other countries?</p>
