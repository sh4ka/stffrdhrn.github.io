<p>If you didn't know I work for an england based company called <a title="SurfControl plc" href="http://www.surfcontrol.com/">SurfControl</a>. As I stated previously we recently had a high flux of new bugs in our RiskFilter product.  Now that has settled and all of the software bugs are getting fixed. Actually all of the bugs have solutions except for one big nasty one in some native code which we interface with through JNI. The problem there is that the code is not maintained by the development team in Beijing so it's taking longer than usual to resolve.</p>
<p>Everything has been good in my personal life. I met a guy from Indonesia who also plays guitar. We jammed together the other day and our music was sounding really nice.  I hope to get some good recording software installed on my machine soon so I can do some recording sessions and start posting them for download.</p>
