<p>Well, how stupid this wordpress blogger software is.  I was changing some options and the whole thing doesn't work. I would think that they would put some validation before I change options.  Anyway, I got it to work again by changing my apache root and manually editing the options though mysql. I think I will try another blogger software.</p>
