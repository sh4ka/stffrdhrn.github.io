<p>Just recently, in America, google and t-mobile released the G1.Â  This new phone takes advantage of googles new <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">android </a>mobile OS.</p>
<p>I have been waiting to see if this phone is worth the wait, if not I will buy the iPhone.Â  So far things look bad. There is no sign of a Japan release and the first edition from the US does not look so promising. One <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=22985&amp;pagtype=allchandate">review </a>sums up G1 pretty well with 10 shortcomings. From my perspective only 5 of these issues are valid, lets see why:</p>
<p><strong>Â Doesn't bother me</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No exchange - I dont use exchange for personal mail, neither should most people</li>
<li>Desktop synching - This phone is meant to privide access to web services, the desktop is obsolete</li>
<li>Skimpy Storage - For me, 1GB is enough</li>
<li>No video recording - Who really uses video recording? Its a novelty item</li>
<li>Accelerometer quirk - I Can write my own software if I need to fix this</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sucks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted: 3.5mm headphone jack</li>
<li>Stingy data cap</li>
<li>Battery life</li>
<li>Uninspiring interface</li>
<li>Multitouch MIA</li>
</ul>
<p>For now I will be planning on getting an iPhone for me and my girlfriend and wait for the Japan release before considering android again.</p>
