<p>Well, I have been away for a while and have been losing a lot of time to work on E17.  Now they seem to be <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=23592120&forum_id=6427">paying</a> people to fix bugs on the project.  I don't need money to work on it, I just need a bit more free time.</p>
<p>I just got back from a series of business trips. Once to the bay area in the US and the next week to Sydney Australia. I don't feel like traveling much anymore. Take a look at the picture below of the view from <a title="Taronga Zoo" href="http://www.sydney.com.au/zoo.htm">Taronga Zoo</a>.<br />
