<p>Something new has happened lately.  I have become a huge Nine Inch Nails fan.  I always listened to them and thought it was ok. Now I find myself listening to the music all of the time and all of it seems to stay bouncing around inside of my head.</p>
<p>It all started when I went down to Yokohama a few weeks back.  I saw a CD store and figured I should pick up a new CD.  The only thing that looked good was a new Nine Inch Nails release "Year Zero".  I picked it up and forgot about it for about a day, then finally listened to it.  I thought, this is OK, a few songs are good.  A few days passed and I listened to it again.  This time I was blown away, the music really sank in and I was able to get it all.</p>
<p>Next thing I know I went to their website and found that they were having a concert in Tokyo.  I got tickets to the concert and it was amazing. I never thougt of them as a rock band, but Trent came out with his <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/default.asp?ProductID=36&amp;CollectionID=5" title="Les Paul, something like this">Epiphone Les Paul</a> and created some of the heaviest sounding guitar riffs I have ever heard.</p>
<p>I just bought a new CD/DVD (WITH_TEETH):</p>
