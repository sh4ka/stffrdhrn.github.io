<p>Today I received a mail on the enlightenment file list and I was suprised to see a little icon displayed in the mail header.  As you may know, I have working on mail filtering servers before, so I am very familiar with how e-mail works and the various headers.</p>
<p>I was supprised to discover the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Face" title="X Face it Up!"> X-Face</a> header.  It seems to be a pretty neat idea but its rather limited, See below.  Anyway, I was just wondering what happens if I try to clear up the image a bit.  I applied a 5.0 px gaussian blut and I got what looks like ablurred photograph.</p>
<p>Now, if everyone placed their own faces in their emails using this technique I might be inclined to write a patch for my mail client, Sylpheed, to automatically apply the blur. The only problem is that this is not very popular at all.</p>
