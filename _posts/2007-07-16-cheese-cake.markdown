<p>I went down to Yokohama (æ¨ªæµœ) with my girlfriend Sachi yesterday to watch Harry Potter and go shopping. Originally I wanted to buy some song books to learn some Japanese songs.  In the music store I happened to bump into something intesting.  I found that the kurosawa music store there carries house made guitars of the name 'Stafford'.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons I had to buy one.  The guitar I picked up is called 'Maple Cheese Cake'  because of the material and color. See below:</p>

<p>Nice guitar, ready to play.</p>

<p>Brand name on the back.</p>
