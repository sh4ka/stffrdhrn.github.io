<p>As I said last time I was going to go to the bank.  So I did, I went down to two foreign banks, <a href="http://www.hsbc.com.cn/">HSBC</a> and <a title="Citibank China" href="http://www.citibank.com.cn/">Citibank</a>.  Both banks are chinese subdivisions so they can not provide the services of the larger parent companies.</p>
<p>Citibank china only offers a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi">RMB</a> savings account.  No ATM card, no Credit card, no money exchange. The only thing is offers is over the counter money access and an online wealth management service.  Since I need access to my money in foreign countries this is no good.</p>
<p>HSBC offers a little more.  They offer money exchange, but they charge 0.25% for extracting USD and EUR. The charge for converting JPY is 0.35%.  This account is also useless as I can only get my money out of the bank over the counter in their Beijing office. I think they also offer money transfter to international bank accounts, but there is also a fee the needs to be paid for this.</p>
<p>In the end I chose to just stay with my chinese bank China Merchants bank and get a Visa credit card. This will allow me to access my money work wide. I can still can not exchange RMB for foreign currency in china.</p>
