<p>Its been a busy year.  A few weeks back I took some time off for golden week and traveled to Bali Indonesia.  We left on May 5th and flew back on may 10th. While in Bali, Sachi and I found plenty of things to keep us busy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rented a bali bike, 50,000 rupiah a day</li>
<li>Played golf in Ulu watu <a href="http://www.golflink-resorts.com/">New Kuta</a></li>
<li>Drank beer, <a href="http://www.balihaibeer.com/intro.html">Bali Hai </a>is better than <a href="http://www.multibintang.co.id/">Bintang</a></li>
<li>Rafting</li>
<li>Ate dinner kalimantan</li>
<li>Hiking in the rice terrace, surrounded by jungle</li>
<li>Went to a Spa</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately I have been up to other things. I have acquired quite a few new and old hobbies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing Golf</li>
<li>Baking</li>
<li>Working on <a href="http://www.shorne-pla.net/contacts/">contacts</a> application</li>
</ul>
